
Stepping into the mouth of the cave, darkness envelopes you. Your feet slip
and slide on the wet rocks as you avoid the drips from the upper teeth of
the entrance.

Losing your footing, you throw yourself against the wall of the cave,
fingers digging through the crumbling rock.

Stumbling along the wall into the belly of the beast, you are, stopped in your
tracks by an unseen force. Pushing against it, you hear a disturbance from the
other side.

Unknown:      What? Who? Why do you come here?!
     
The devilish squeal stops you in your tracks. There was no mention of someone
else being here. Is this a trap?
     
Unknown:      You... come no further! I won't let you through! Brute force
              will do you no good. The barrier is sealed by a puzzle that
              only a being of nature could twig. You have only three attempts
              before the cave eats you alive! Heh heh heh... good luck!

The sounds of scurrying feet move away from you.
