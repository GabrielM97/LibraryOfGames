Your aching limbs stretch out as you stand and an intake of breath shapes a
yawn. Straightening your clothing and shrugging the backpack into place, you
mark your location on your map.

Turning around, you stop.

There it is.

Trepidation runs through you.

The blood pumps in your ears and you feel the adrenaline clear away any
remaining feelings of comfort and peace.
This is it.

This is what you have been looking for.
