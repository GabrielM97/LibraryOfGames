Clicking the torch off, you tear into the bag and grasp the flask, gulping the
warm liquid.

Aware that this precious commodity is limited, you reluctantly take one last
mouth full of water and swill it around your mouth before swallowing.
Exhaustion overwhelms you.

Placing the flask back in your bag, the coarse material brushes your chin as
you clutch it to your chest and curl up for a few short hours of sleep.
