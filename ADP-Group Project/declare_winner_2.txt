Suited Man:       If your ticket is called, you will be taken to the edge
                  of the forest where the cave is located. Due to thick
                  underbrush, we can't get a vehicle straight to the entrance
                  and so your journey will begin on foot. As far as we know,
                  there are no bears or dangerous wildlife in the forest but,
                  obviously we can't say for certain.

Murmurings come from the crowd and people slither away like snakes in the
brush.
