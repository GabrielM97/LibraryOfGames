You are walking between the shops and street callers when a flyer is thrust
into your hand. The crowd carries you along as you peer down at the square
of paper.

Street Caller:   Roll up, roll up! Sign up now – fame and fortune await!

A tight grip pulls you from the crowd.

Street Caller:   Hey, you.

You look into the face of the street-caller and pull your arm free.

Street Caller:   You look like you are up for a challenge, what’dya think?

You pause, taken by surprise.
