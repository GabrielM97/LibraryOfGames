The cawing symphony of birds and brightening light stir you from sleep.

Rays of sunlight shine between the leaves, creating great beams of light. The
high rise home of the chorus oppressively towers overhead. The residents
chatter to their neighbours, perched at different levels.

Slowly reaching into the bag for your map and compass, you rattle the
lightweight cooking pots and a nearby squirrel scrambles away, scrunching
leaves and scratching bark.
