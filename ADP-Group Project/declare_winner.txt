Before you can further contemplate your fate, a small, bald man in a grey pin-
stripe suit steps up onto a banana box and rings a shrill bell.

An eerie quiet falls and the suited man clears his throat. 

Suited Man:       Ahem.. Before we draw the winning number, I think it is only
                  fair to give you the chance to turn around and go home, back
                  to family, friends and your lives.

A rumble of indecision sounds through the crowd. Eyes of the bystanders dart
from one shaking square of paper to another. The rumble dies away and feet
stand cemented to the floor.
