                 It’s real simple... You pull a ticket out of the bucket.
                 Hold onto it and t’night we draw!
                 The lucky, or possibly unlucky, ticket holder goes in to
                 play for it all!
                 Real simple, eh?
                 Sooo... You in? Go on, what have ya’ got to lose?
