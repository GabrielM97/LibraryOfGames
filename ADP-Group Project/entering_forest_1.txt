Your torch shines into a small opening where a small weathered well stands
proudly amongst the foliage. It calls to you as a place to rest.

After clearing the area, torch between your teeth, you throw your backpack to
one side and slump against the mossy wall.

Legs throbbing from miles of uneven footing and each cautious step, you fall
backwards with pants of relief and moans of pain as you briefly close your
eyes.

The promise of hydration beckons from your backpack.
