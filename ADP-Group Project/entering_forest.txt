The undergrowth gives way beneath your feet as you stumble into the mouth of
the forest. Two long days into your expedition, you hope desperately that you
are close.

The song of birds died away long ago with the falling Sun and only the calls
from insects and small mammals join your laboured breaths. It has been hours
since you rested and your throat is beginning to burn from the lack of fluid.

You don’t know how much longer you can hold off guzzling the satisfying
contents of the water flask. The weight of supplies in your backpack bears
heavily on you.

Your body hurts.
